              <h2>Editorial Workflow</h2>
              <p>
                Every article goes through intake, fact gathering, rewriting, and peer review. Automated tools surface leads, but final copy only ships after human editors verify numbers, add background, and align tone with our guidelines.

                <li>Primary source validation and citation review.</li>
                <li>Headline and deck shaping to emphasize reader takeaways.</li>
                <li>Copy editing for clarity, neutrality, and consistency.</li>
