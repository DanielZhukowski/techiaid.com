              <h2>How We Work</h2>
              <p>
                Articles start with trusted feeds, research repositories, and first-party statements. Editors validate claims, check citations, and produce fresh copy that reflects the evolving facts of each story. We update posts when new information emerges.
              </p>
              <p>
                We apply the same review checklist to every rewrite: confirm the primary source, cross-check numbers, contextualize timelines, and flag speculation. If we cannot confirm a claim, we either omit it or explain the uncertainty.
